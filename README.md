# SecureScan

Research has shown that the WiFi scanning procedure, or handshake, is insecure. SecureScan is a novel, high level protocol designed to facilitate WiFi scanning without compromising the privacy of a user or their device.

## Overview

 - `protocol`: Provides a formal specification for the SecureScan protocol using a Secure Protocol THeorY (`.spthy`) supported by Tamarin, an open access protocol security formal model checker. Contains a specification for the protocol as well as lemmas which demonstrate (and prove) the protocol's correctness and security in a Dolev Yao formal model and demonstrate corresponding attacks or vulnerabilities in the current WiFi standard.
 - `simulation`: Provides a high level implementation of the protocol in Python, which performs analysis on WiFi traffic generated by both SecureScan and the current WiFi standard to quantify their security, privacy and efficiency. A Gaussian NB classifier is used to evaluate the privacy afforded to stations in the network based on their probe requests.
 - `plotter`: Given a set of results retrieved from `simulation`, provides an interface by which said results can be shown in meaningful graphs.

 ## Development

 The SecureScan protocol was developed as part of Alistair Robinson's third year dissertation in Computer Science at the University of Warwick DCS.
